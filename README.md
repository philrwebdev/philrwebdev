# Hi and welcome to my Github Webdev Repo!

I'm Philip and today started my three months trip to the world of web development today. I come from the realm of linguistics, R and other mysterious things and am looking forward to learn some useful stuff on the front- and backend side that allows me to connect my previous work with what I did before.

Some of the things I like:

- Coding
- Getting to know new skills and people
- Data
- Chilis
- Hot food
- Cooking hot food with chilis
- Table tennis
- Lakes
